I’ve read great works, and I know how talented writers look like. This is probably the main reason I refuse to start writing.\nI can never allow myself to produce trash especially when I know what masterpiece looks like.\nDespite that, I did start to learn violin a couple years ago. I like to go to classical music concerts and listening to the recordings of those virtuoso soloists, but I also find it fun to spend hours, without realizing, practicing to improve my squeaky sound. I guess the reason why I began to type down this article regardlessly is the same. I feel this inner compulsion to.\nRecently when I cleaned up my laptop, I was surprised to stumble upon some scratch I wrote 10 years ago. This is why technology is a double-sided sword. It stays forever. Just as how embarrassed I feel when I read those essays, I probably would have the same reaction when I read this blog 10 years later, probably. That’s why I refused to blog.\nHow immature and ridiculous my thoughts were would stay in the mass database of internet forever. Seriously, one of my high school writing assignment that was published in my school’s blog is still there with a pretty decent SEO ranking if you put my name and the school there. It’s cringy.\nDespite the cringe, they are like the post-it tabs. They do remind me of the flow of mind I had then and small pieces of things happened to me at that time. Reading those cringy essays is like looking at a photo album. They record more than my brain can remember.\nI battle myself every time when the idea of starting writing resurfaces. I also know that I can never make it to a better writer if I don’t write anything now and open them to criticism.\nMoreover, there are so many bad trashy publications out there blatantly asking people to pay for them. (I am very serious about this rant.) If you are also struggling whether to start writing or blogging, just think about them.\nTo anyone who feels the same as I did, consider this: part of it in writing is to fulfill your own impulses, while the other part of it is to leave an album for your future self to refresh all the pleasant or cringy but sparkling memories.\nAnd to reconcile with the cringy part, this is how I pacify myself: remember that everyone is born and built differently. Your unique perspective may be helpful to someone who has never explored the subjects you write about. And if you just take a moment\u0026ndash;why do you find your old writing cringy-—it\u0026rsquo;s very likely because you\u0026rsquo;ve evolved into a better writer since then.\n","date":"2024-02-05T20:12:32-05:00","permalink":"https://kassieyang.github.io/p/why-do-i-start-blogging-now/","title":"Why Do I Start Blogging Now"}]
